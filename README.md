# Climate-change-model
Workshop during the summer-school in Grenoble: Exploring climate model data using Is-enes.
We have studied how temperature/pressure/wind/precipitations will change during the next years (until the year 2100).
We have plotted the mean/max/min of these parameters and the mean trend of them during the years.
